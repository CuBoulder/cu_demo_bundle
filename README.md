The CU Demo Bundle allows us to create a Demo Web Express site, in which anyone with an IdentiKey can login and view settings and configuration of the nodes and blocks, but they can't save anything or change the site in any way.

To use, go to admin/config/development/atlas in your WebExpress site and download cu_demo_bundle. Next, go to admin/modules and enable "Demo Site."
